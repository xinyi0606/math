# Purpose

Audit the complete mathematical modeling contest solution before final submission.

This skill is the **third of three independent auditors** that together form Gate G6. It runs after `consistency-auditor` and `completeness-auditor` and consumes their reports as inputs — it does NOT re-do their checks. Each auditor catches a different failure mode:

- `consistency-auditor` → cross-media numbers / files / symbols / parameters (does the paper claim match the code?)
- `completeness-auditor` → audit/review files exist on disk with ≥ 5 pass items (did the producer skills actually write what they claimed?)
- **`quality-assurance-auditor` (this skill)** → workflow completeness, three critical rules, anti-fabrication, paper quality (is the whole pipeline coherent and defensible?)

This skill checks whether the solution answers every subquestion, whether models / code / results / figures / robustness checks / paper sections are mutually coherent, whether the full workflow completeness requirements are met, and whether unsupported claims or missing artifacts block final delivery.

This skill verifies that every subquestion has gone through the full delivery chain: candidate methods (with PoC) → experiments → final method explanation → final result analysis → solution package (with frozen_numbers.json) → paper sections.

This skill does not invent missing results, rewrite the full paper, rerun models, or approve submission when evidence is incomplete. **It also does not approve assembly if the other two audits (consistency / completeness) are missing or failed** — the three are orthogonal and all must converge.

# When to use

Use this skill:

- After `paper-section-writer` has drafted paper sections for all subquestions.
- Before final assembly or submission.
- When checking whether the solution is logically complete.
- When identifying blocking issues, minor issues, and repair actions.
- When deciding whether to return to an upstream skill.

# Preconditions

The following should already exist or be provided:

- Parsed problem and subquestions.
- Problem classification.
- Candidate method pools per subquestion.
- Data report and cleaned data summary, if data is used.
- Reviewed model code.
- Model result artifacts per subquestion.
- Robustness or sensitivity reports per subquestion.
- Figure-table plans per subquestion.
- Paper section drafts for all subquestions.

If paper sections are missing, hand back to `paper-section-writer`.

If model results are missing, hand back to `python-model-code-generator`, `matlab-model-code-generator`, or `code-reviewer`.

# Workflow

0. **Verify sibling auditors have run (independent audit layer prerequisite).**
   - Check that `paper/audits/cross_media_consistency_audit.md` exists with verdict PASSED.
   - Check that `paper/audits/completeness_audit.md` exists with verdict PASSED.
   - If either is missing, route to it first — do not pretend QA can substitute for them.
   - If either has FAILED verdict, treat that as a BLOCKING issue and inherit its repair routing.
   - Only when both sibling audits PASSED, proceed to step 1.

   QA is the third independent auditor, not a super-auditor that subsumes the others.

1. Check problem coverage.
   - Verify every original subquestion is represented in the paper.
   - Verify each subquestion has a corresponding model, result, and written answer.
   - Mark unanswered or partially answered subquestions as blocking issues.

2. **Check workflow completeness (NEW — expanded check).**
   - For each subquestion, verify the full delivery chain:
     1. Candidate method pool exists (`methods/Qx/qx_method_candidates.md`).
     2. Experiment reports exist (at least one round at `results/Qx/experiments/roundN/`).
     3. Method iteration log exists (`methods/Qx/qx_method_iteration_log.md`).
     4. Final method explanation exists (`methods/Qx/qx_final_method_explanation.md`).
     5. Final result analysis exists (`results/Qx/reports/qx_final_result_analysis.md`).
     6. Solution package exists (`results/Qx/reports/qx_solution_package_for_writer.md`).
     7. Robustness report exists (`robustness/Qx/qx_robustness_report.md`) or a justified exception.
     8. Figure-table plan exists (`methods/Qx/qx_figure_table_plan.md`).
   - Mark any missing link in this chain as a blocking issue.

3. Check the three critical rules.
   - Rule 1: Verify paper model description matches the final method explanation (not an early candidate pool).
   - Rule 2: Verify paper results come from the final result analysis (not raw experiment outputs directly).
   - Rule 3: Verify the solution package exists and the paper writer used it.

4. Check artifact lineage.
   - Trace each major paper claim back to problem parse, method explanation, data, code, result, figure, or robustness artifact.
   - Mark claims without artifacts as unsupported.

5. Check model consistency.
   - Verify models match the classified problem types.
   - Verify baseline models exist for main models unless explicitly justified.
   - Verify the paper describes the final method (from `qx_final_method_explanation.md`), not an earlier candidate.
   - Verify eliminated methods are mentioned appropriately.

6. Check data and result consistency.
   - Verify raw data was not overwritten.
   - Verify cleaned data and field mappings are documented.
   - Verify result tables come from reviewed scripts or accepted computation.
   - Verify units, variables, and dimensions are consistent.

7. Check paper quality.
   - Verify every referenced figure or table exists on disk.
   - Verify figures in the paper match the figure-table plan's Type 3 (论文图) classification.
   - Verify no Type 1 (诊断图) figures accidentally appear in the paper.
   - Verify every figure or table has a source artifact.
   - Verify captions support the intended claim.
   - Verify assumptions are necessary and linked to modeling needs.
   - Verify notation is defined before use and consistent with the global symbol table.
   - Verify conclusions map back to subquestions.
   - Verify limitations are not hidden.
   - Reject decorative or unsupported visuals.

8. Check for fabrication and exaggeration.
   - Verify no references are fabricated.
   - Verify no numerical values are invented.
   - Verify no experiments are claimed that were not run.
   - Verify robustness claims do not exceed completed checks.
   - Verify conclusions do not exceed evidence.
   - Flag any claim that cannot be traced to an artifact.

9. **Produce a QA report — MANDATORY substantive file on disk.**
   - Save to `paper/qa_report.md`.
   - **List ≥ 5 explicit pass items** with file:line evidence (concrete checks, not "all good"). These are checked by `completeness-auditor`.
   - Separate blocking issues from minor issues.
   - Provide a repair plan.
   - Route each repair to the appropriate upstream skill.
   - **Approve final assembly only when ALL THREE auditors PASS** (this skill + consistency-auditor + completeness-auditor). Document the cross-auditor verdict explicitly in the report.
   - If sibling auditors are missing or failed (step 0), QA cannot approve assembly — note this and route appropriately.

## Repair Plan

1. **BLOCKING**: Run `final-method-explainer` for Q2 to produce `methods/Q2/q2_final_method_explanation.md`.
2. **BLOCKING**: Run `workflow-orchestrator` to plan Q3 and Q4 execution.
3. **MINOR**: Update Q1 Figure 1.3 caption via `paper-section-writer`.
4. **MINOR**: Add boundary condition statement to Q1 robustness report via `robustness-checker`.

## Recommended Next Skill

- **If QA failed**: `workflow-orchestrator` (with repair plan)
- **If QA passed**: `workflow-orchestrator` (for final assembly)
```

- [ ] Solution package exists and was used as primary source

## Problem coverage
- [ ] Every subquestion is answered in the paper
- [ ] Every answer has model-result-paper alignment

## Model consistency

- [ ] Eliminated methods are mentioned where appropriate

## Evidence quality
- [ ] Every numerical claim has a result artifact
- [ ] Every figure or table has a source artifact
- [ ] Every figure in the paper exists on disk
- [ ] No Type 1 (诊断图) figures in the paper
- [ ] Every robustness claim has robustness evidence

## Paper quality
- [ ] Every conclusion maps to a subquestion
- [ ] Assumptions are necessary and stated clearly
- [ ] Notation is defined and consistent (cross-check with global symbol table)
- [ ] Code outputs match paper claims
- [ ] Raw data is preserved
- [ ] Limitations are stated

## Anti-fabrication
- [ ] No fabricated data, references, results, figures, or experiments
- [ ] No invented numerical values
- [ ] No unsupported superiority claims
- [ ] No hidden uncertainty

# Rules

- Do not fabricate missing evidence.
- Do not approve final assembly with blocking issues.
- **Do not approve final assembly unless ALL THREE auditors (consistency / completeness / this skill) PASS.** A single auditor's "✅" is not sufficient — the three are orthogonal.
- Do not re-do the work of `consistency-auditor` (cross-media number/file/symbol checks) or `completeness-auditor` (audit-file existence checks). Consume their reports as inputs.
- Do not approve "完成" verbally. Write the substantive `paper/qa_report.md` with ≥ 5 explicit pass items. `completeness-auditor` will flag a verbal-only QA as MISSING.
- Do not hide uncertainty.
- Do not treat planned artifacts as completed artifacts.
- Do not rewrite the full paper inside QA.
- Do not rerun models unless explicitly asked by the user.
- Do not change upstream artifacts silently.
- Route repairs to the correct upstream skill.
- Keep QA findings specific and actionable.
- Check workflow completeness — it's not just about paper quality.

# Verification

Before approving final assembly, verify:

- `blocking_issues` is empty.
- `workflow_completeness_check` passes for all subquestions (8/8 checks per subquestion, or justified exceptions).
- `three_critical_rules_check` passes for all subquestions.
- `unsupported_claims` is empty or explicitly removed from final text.
- Every subquestion is covered.
- Baseline and robustness requirements are satisfied.
- All figures and tables are traceable.
- Final conclusions do not exceed evidence.
- No fabrication risks detected.
- **Sibling auditors PASSED**: `paper/audits/cross_media_consistency_audit.md` (PASSED) AND `paper/audits/completeness_audit.md` (PASSED).
- **`paper/qa_report.md` exists with ≥ 5 explicit pass items** — this file is the output of THIS skill; verify it was actually written.
- `final_assembly_allowed` is true only when the cross-auditor verdict is `ALL_PASSED`.

# Failure modes

Stop and report a blocker if:

- Paper sections are missing.
- Model results are missing.
- Robustness evidence is missing before final delivery.
- Figures or tables are referenced but not available.
- Claims cannot be traced to artifacts.
- Subquestions are unanswered.
- Any critical rule is violated.
- Workflow completeness chain is broken.
- Final assembly is requested before QA passes.

# Stop conditions

This skill must stop instead of guessing when:

- An issue requires missing data or missing result artifacts.
- The paper and code describe incompatible models.
- Final conclusions depend on unsupported claims.
- Fixing the issue requires upstream modeling, code, or data work.
- Continuing would require inventing evidence.

When stopping, output:
- blocker
- why it matters
- affected section or subquestion
- required artifact
- recommended repair skill
- next action

# Handoff

If QA passes:
→ `workflow-orchestrator` with `final_assembly_allowed: true`.

If QA fails:
→ `workflow-orchestrator` with repair plan routing to the relevant upstream skill.

Repair routing:
- `problem-parser` → missing or misread subquestions
- `problem-classifier` → wrong task type mapping
- `method-selector` → missing candidate pool
- `data-auditor-cleaner` → data issues
- `model-code-analyzer` or code generators → missing code
- `code-reviewer` → code or artifact issues
- `result-report-generator` → missing experiment report or final result analysis
- `final-method-explainer` → missing final method explanation
- `solution-package-builder` → missing solution package
- `robustness-checker` → missing stability evidence
- `figure-table-planner` → unsupported visuals or missing figure plan
- `paper-section-writer` → writing or traceability issues
